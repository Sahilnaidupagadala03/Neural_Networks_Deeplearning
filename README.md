# Neural_Networks_Deeplearning Assignment 1
Neural_Network_ICP1_700748694 summary:
Q1a: The code takes a user-inputted string, removes at least the first two characters, reverses the remaining characters, and then prints the result.
Q1b: The code takes two numbers from the user, performs basic arithmetic operations, and then prints the results, taking care to handle the case where division by zero might occur.
Q2: The code allows the user to input a sentence, replaces occurrences of 'python' with 'pythons', and then displays the modified sentence.
Q3: The code allows the user to input a class score, determines the corresponding letter grade based on a predefined grading scale, and then displays the result. If the entered score is outside the valid range, it is labeled as "Invalid score."
