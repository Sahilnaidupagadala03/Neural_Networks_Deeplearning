Q1a: The code takes a user-inputted string, removes at least the first two characters, reverses the remaining characters, and then prints the result.
Q1b: The code takes two numbers from the user, performs basic arithmetic operations, and then prints the results, taking care to handle the case where division by zero might occur.
Q2: The code allows the user to input a sentence, replaces occurrences of 'python' with 'pythons', and then displays the modified sentence.
Q3: The code allows the user to input a class score, determines the corresponding letter grade based on a predefined grading scale, and then displays the result. If the entered score is outside the valid range, it is labeled as "Invalid score."

Q1a: This Python code defines a function called fullname that takes two parameters (first_name and last_name), concatenates them with a space in between, and returns the full name. The code then prompts the user to enter their first and last names, calls the fullname function with the provided inputs, and prints the resulting full name.
Q1b: The code defines a function string_alternative that returns every second character of a given string. It then uses this function to process a previously obtained full name (result), displaying both the original full name and the result obtained by selecting every second character.
Q2: 
The code defines a Python function wordcount_per_line that reads lines from an input file, counts the occurrences of each word, and writes both the original lines and the word counts to an output file. The main part of the code specifies input and output file names, calls the function with these names, and handles the case where the input file is not found.
Q3a: 
The code defines a function to convert heights from inches to centimeters. It prompts the user to enter the number of customers and their heights in inches, converting and storing the values. The code handles invalid input and then prints both the input heights in inches and the corresponding converted heights in centimeters.
Q3b: 
The code initializes a list of heights in inches, prints the original list, and then creates a new list by converting each height to centimeters (multiplied by 2.54). The code prints both the original list in inches and the new list representing the heights in centimeters.

Q1: 
The code illustrates inheritance by defining an Employee class that has a subclass called FullTimeEmployee. It includes a static method to determine the average wage of a list of employees called calculate_average_salary. Both classes contain an initialization method called init, and FullTimeEmployee uses super() to initialize the parent class. The total number of workers is tracked through the usage of a class variable called total_employees. Instances of both classes are generated, added to a list, and the average wage is computed and shown in the main function. A dedicated method, display_fulltime_benefits, is introduced by the FullTimeEmployee class to emphasize benefits for full-time employees.

Q2: 
The code generates a random 1D array, reshapes it into a 2D array, finds the indices of maximum values in each row, and replaces those maximum values with 0 in the respective rows.
